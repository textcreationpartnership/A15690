         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren, for as much as theſe times doe rather menace VVarre then Peace, men of our calling ſhould be readie <hi>ad omne quare,</hi> for our King and Country. Wee and our Country haue beene long happy in peace, and now it ſeemes the times preſage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Wherefore from the wiſe heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, let vs all learne as followeth, <hi>Iam tua res agitur pare cum proximus ardet.</hi> I deſire in briefe, to let you know, that our Company were commanded by Authoritie, to provide ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of the beſt Surgions at this time to be had for his Majeſties ſpeciall ſervice, ſuch as are men moſt expert in the healing of wounds made with Gun-ſhott. And generally, for the moſt part, I know many of vs that would be eſteemed good Surgions, being put to it, at the
<pb facs="tcp:2371:3"/> firſt will be ſomewhat to ſeeke therein, how much more then our young men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter of providing, preparing, and fitting his Majeſties ſervice, being by his Highnes referred to our Corporation. And our Company having for the time deputed my ſelfe to the worke. I am tyed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to doe ſomewhat, though I confeſſe, it be little to the better inabling and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our younger men vnto their duties in that point. But before my entrance thereunto, I could in my dutie doe no leſſe then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with thoſe eſpeciall favours which it hath pleaſed our gracious King to beſtow vpon our Corporation in particular, aboue and beyond his ever-bleſſed Anceſtors, for our incouragement, to enable vs the more chearefully to ſerue him Firſt, his Highnes hath beene pleaſed to augment the monethly wages of each Surgion and Surgions-mate in his Sea-ſervice, almoſt to a third penny. He hath alſo beene graciouſly pleaſed to giue as free a benevolence to the Surgions in all his Sea-ſervices, which never was given them before, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> to all Surgions that ſerue in his Highnes owne Ships, I meane to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:2371:3"/> the furniſhing of the Surgions Cheſts, for each of them x<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Vnto each Marchants Ship, imployed in his ſervice v<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. And to each New-caſtle Ship iij<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. And nevertheleſſe, his Highnes is well pleaſed that the Surgions may demand and take by the head of all men that are in pay in any of his Shipps ij<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of each man by the moneth, as they did before. And for the Surgions in his Land-ſervice at preſent, he alloweth each Surgeon ij<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. vj<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. the day, which is iij<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. xv<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. the moneth, and to each mate iij<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. a moneth: And moreover, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and giveth to each Surgion appointed to 250. men a Surgeons Cheſt of xvij<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. vallew, and over and aboue a Magazin or ſtore-cheſt of xlviij<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. vallew, for to ſupply and furniſh vpon all wants. His Highnes hath further beene well pleaſed to giue authoritie vnto the Maſters and Governors of our Societie, for to haue the making, compounding, fitting, and ordering of all the Medicines, as well Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals Chirurgicall; together with all other proviſions belonging to the Surgions Cheſt, he hath referred to the Maſters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of our Societie. Theſe favours and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges our Corporation haue received from
<pb facs="tcp:2371:4"/> his Highnes, together with his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and graunt vnto vs of a new Charter, wherein he hath likewiſe gratiouſly beene pleaſed to promiſe to confirme all our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges formerly graunted vnto vs, and to giue vs divers new priviledges for the better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of our Corporation in future times.</p>
            <p>And now having acquainted you with his Maieſties favours vnto our Corporation, it followeth in my dutie that I ſhould acquaint the younger ſort of Surgions with the vſe of the Surgions Cheſt, I meane the particular medicines therein contained, and that in ſome methodicall manner, were it not that time haſtens me to an end before I begin, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe I haue ſtrained of time to lend the younger ſort a word or two for a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> not to all as a teacher, but as a loving Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer to the elder, which I pray you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and vſe as you haue occaſion. And ſo in Gods name without painting of phraſes, or collecting of great Authors, my methode you may know by the plaineneſſe of the ſtile, and my methode is no other then the old beaten path-way of all Surgions, wherin each Artiſt ought to be vnderſtanding: And if any Artiſt
<pb facs="tcp:2371:4"/> by forgetfulneſſe erre, I deſire but to informe his memory, and craue his charitable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And for the younger ſort, I know it is charitie to ſhew them, for they haue neede, and ought to deſire and ſeeke knowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an old doctrine of that ſweet <hi>Lillie</hi> in his Grammer rules, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>I knowing you could not haue the learned adviſe of the graue Doctors at hand to adviſe you, made me preſume I confeſſe ſomewhat beyond my ſcope: Wherefore in want of the aforeſaid helpes, conſult with good Authors in their wants, with the Surgions mate, and this poore <hi>Extempore.</hi>

               <p>If diſcolouring, bliſtering, or other apparant ſhewes <note place="margin">Beware a Gangrena</note> of a <hi>Gangrena</hi> appeare, giue the patient a Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Cordiall, then ſcarifie gently at the firſt, and deeply afterwards, as cauſe ſhall vrge, and haue ready a <hi>Lixiuims,</hi> made of water and aſhes, to the height of an ordinary ley, that Women vſe to driue Bucks with: And put a reaſonable quantitie of common Salt into it, and when it is cleered, if you haue hearbes, as Scordium, Wormewood, Centaney, Hipericon, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momill, Mellilot, or the like, or <hi>Lupines,</hi> make vſe of them, according to Art, it will be much the better, if

You may never in any caſe boyle <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> without error; For the ſpirits will evaporate, and the vertue reſteth in them.</p>
               <p>Obſerue in great lacerated wounds, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> If you finde by the wound that the one halfe of the member be taken away, there is no hope to ſaue on the reſt. But you are rather to make preſent Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for that the reſt is contuſed, and muſt therefore <note place="margin">Iuſt cauſe of Amputation.</note> admit, by conſagument ſome loſſe of ſubſtance by ſupperation, and then the remaining part can doe no ſeruice to the bodie, but will indanger the life of the patient, and be a hinderance. Nay, I dare ſay, if but halfe of any member be taken away, with the fracture of the bone, it is impoſſible to ſaue it on to doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. If you haue <hi>Hemoragie,</hi> I meane bleeding or weeping of Veines or Arteries in your worke, ſearch for that Veine or that Artery that bleedeth. If you cannot make legature, which ſeldome or never you can in Gun-ſhott-wounds, then apply to the end of the Veine an actuall Cautery, a ſmall one will ſerue, but apply it very hott, and not all over the wound, onely to that Veine if you can which bleedeth; you may if the <hi>Fluxe</hi> be not great, vſe burning hott <hi>Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaoum</hi> vpon Lynt dipt and neately brought to the place, and then well boulſtered, But a ſmall actuall

I dare ſay, that in contuſed wounds of Gun-ſhott, they force and draw a <hi>Gangrena,</hi> if not death thereby, by but thening nature, by obſtructing the parts, and grieving the patient. It is a ſafe and faire way at the firſt dreſſing ever to ſtriue to ioyne together the parts of all inciſed wounds, and vnite the wounded parts, if it may be, with this cuation to order that fit breathing be left to evacuate the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours, then to apply apt and fit aſtringent medicaments outwardly over all together, with apt and due ligature, and by that courſe to ſtay a <hi>Fluxe.</hi> But in contuſed and lacerated wounds of Gun-ſhott, the Surgion hath nto that benefit, but muſt truſt to other helpes not ſo readie, namely, as is ſaid in the leſſer wounds, to very warme Balmes, aſtringent, defenſatiues, and good ligature, and in greater wounds to Cauſticke Medicaments, Cauteries, and forcible helpes.</p>

               <p>Alſo on the other ſide, over-ſlacke binding is as bade; due, comely, and ſmooth ligature, with the due compoſing the parts wounded with ſoft and ſmooth boulſtering, greatly honoureth the Artiſt, and cureth the Patient almoſt as much as the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <p>Obſerue alſo, that you put never one Cauſticke or Eſkaroticke Medicine after another too ſonne, namely, not vntill the firſt Eskar: hath beene gone at the leaſt three dayes.

And the Surgion doe deſire to clenſe that part, ſtriue to vſe your Cauſticke Medicine, namely, your hott <hi>Egiptiacum,</hi> or a Cautery if you can apply it onely on that place, and not all over the wound.</p>
               <p>For you are to conſider, that as too much gleeting, <note place="margin">Over-drying Medicines dangerous.</note> weeping, or expence of humiditie from wounds of Gun-ſhott is dangerous many wayes; ſo too much vſe of drying Medicaments in wounds made with Gun-ſhott, is no leſſe dangerous by ſtopping the pores, repelling the peccant humors by reaſon of the contuſion collected, being choaked in the wound, aptly indanger a <hi>Gangrena,</hi> and all other deadly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, incident therevnto.</p>
